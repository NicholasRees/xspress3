<p> The XSPRESS3 system contains a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA with two embedded PowerPC processors. PPC1 manages the DMA engines. PPC1 runs the Xilinx micro kernel and communicates to the Intel 64 bit Linux server PC by 1 GBit Ethernet, TCP sockets. Bulk data and event lists to be histogrammed are sent from the firmware to the Server PC by 10G Ethernet, UDP.</p>

Software Overview</h3>
<p>The software API is via the libxspress3.a which provides C calling functions with names xsp3_*. </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="software_setup"></a>
Setup procedure</h4>
<p>The library supports running 1 or more XSPRESS3 systems. Each system can consists of 1 or more FEM cards. To connect to a system of 1 or more boards use the command <a class="el" href="">xsp3_config</a> This returns a handle which should be used to identify the system to all subsequent calls. Next setup the clock source. For normal operation the ADC and data processing clock is set to use the Crystal Oscillator module on the ADC board using xsp3_clocks_setup(path, -1, XSP3_CLK_SRC_XTAL, XSP3_CLK_FLAGS_MASTER | XSP3_CLK_FLAGS_NO_DITHER, 0) For digital only testing it is possible to generate the processing clock from the FEM card on board clocks. For multi board systems, the master board will be set to use the crystal and all the others will use a clock looped from this board. See <a class="el" href="">xsp3_clocks_setup</a> The processing register settings and BRAM contents are then loaded using <a class="el" href="">xsp3_restore_settings</a> The overall run flags should then be set to specify if whether playback data is to be used, whether scope mode debug data should be stored and whether scalers should be recorded. See <a class="el" href="">xsp3_restore_settings</a> The timing control register allows the acquisition enable/disable and time frame number to come from either software control (typically for a quick test) or from hardware (for accurately timed multi-frame experiments) See <a class="el" href="">xsp3_set_glob_timeA</a> and <a class="el" href="">xsp3_set_glob_timeFixed</a> </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="software_user_setup"></a>
User Settings</h4>
<p>The system now needs to need set up to match user specifiable values. In particular the energy windows and RoI positions need to be set to match the energy of the element(s) of interest. Two in windows scalers are provided per channel, typically used to measure the counts in the main characteristic peak of 1 or 2 elements See <a class="el" href="">xsp3_set_window</a> The Histogram data is usually set to collect the full spectrum in 4096 energy bins. Various debug modes are available, but not required for user data. To reduce the data volume, it is also possible to collect regions of interest around the peaks of interest. In this case the total size of each spectrum is reduced from 12 bits = 4096 bins to 11..1 bits =&gt; 2048 .. 2 bins. First the Spectra size is set using <a class="el" href="">xsp3_format_run</a> and then if required RoI are set using <a class="el" href="">xsp3_set_roi</a> </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="Data"></a>
Collection</h4>
<p>Once setup the histogramming memory is cleared using <a class="el" href="">xsp3_histogram_clear</a>. Then the system is started using <a class="el" href="">xsp3_histogram_start</a> If the timing control has been set to a fixed frame from software control, counting then starts. If the timing control has been set to use the external timing inputs, counting is armed, but will occur only when the timing veto input is asserted. If the acqusition is to be software timed, wait for the desired time and then counting disabled using <a class="el" href="">xsp3_histogram_stop</a> If timing if being controlled by hardware, the external timing generator must determine when the exposure is finished. After this call <a class="el" href="">xsp3_histogram_stop</a> to flush remaining data. </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="software_data_access"></a>
Data Access</h4>
<p>The histogram data is stored in /dev/shm shared memory on the Linux server. It can be read at any time, accepting that data read will be slightly stale while histogramming is running. At the end of the experiment, after calling <a class="el" href="">xsp3_histogram_stop</a>, poll <a class="el" href="">xsp3_histogram_is_busy</a> twice to check that the histogramming threads have flushed any network stack buffers. The histogram data can then read read using any of <a class="el" href="">xsp3_histogram_read4d</a>, <a class="el" href="">xsp3_histogram_read3d</a> or <a class="el" href="">xsp3_histogram_read_chan</a> The scaler data is stored in a hardware counter during an acquistion and then transfered to DRAM on the FEM at the end of each frame. For multi-frame experiments, data can be read from the previous frame while the next is counting. To check the DMA channel has written data to memory use <a class="el" href="">xsp3_dma_check_desc</a> The raw scaler data is then read using <a class="el" href="">xsp3_scaler_read</a></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="registers"></a>
Register Layout</h3>
<p>XSPRESS3 register space memory is mapped at 0xA0000000 on a 16 MByte boundary. It is split into 16 “channels” using the top 4 bits of my address space. Channel 0..7(8) will be physical channels and channel 15 is the global register. The remaining channels 10..14 are reserved for future use.<br/>
<br/>
 Within a channel, the top next 4 bits down select a region. Regions 0..8 (plus expansion) address block RAMs with varying sizes. Region 15 contains 30 registers.  <a class="el" href="xspress3_8h.html">xspress3.h</a> XSP3_REGIONS Address Bits </p>

<p>The default network setup is (excluding the site network connection):</p>
