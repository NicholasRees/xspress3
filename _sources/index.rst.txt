Xspress3 Epics Module
==================================

Xspress3Epics provides support for `Quantum Detectors`_ `Xspress3`_ series of
pulse-counting readout electronics for the `EPICS Controls System`_. The
Xspress3 electronics are used with X-ray fluorescence detectors, and provide
high performace in throughput and energy resolution.  Both single- and
multi-element detector systems are supported.  The EPICS driver for Xspress3 is
build on top of EPICS `areaDetector`_ version 3, and supports all variations of
Xspress3, including the "mini" and "X" series.

The driver was originally developed at `Diamond Light Source`_, but has been
developed within the `epics-modules`_ for many years.  Most of the recent
development of the driver has been a collaboration between scientists and
engineers working at the `Advanced Photon Source`_ and `Quantum Detectors`_, and done
at `xspress3 github page`_.

Documentation for the low-level API to the Xspress3 system are at `Xspress3 API Documentation`.
